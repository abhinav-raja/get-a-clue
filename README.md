# Need a Clue?

This is a set of tools I made to help setting wordplay related puzzles. You can find more details about the different kinds of wordplay on the website! 

To generate clues, simply fill in the parameters and generate away. If you like some of the output clues, you can click on them to temporarily save them. When you click 'Generate' again, the nonsaved clues will be cleared and replaced with new ones.

Right now the site is limited to a single dictionary and doesn't check for root word correctness, so it might take a few tries to get good clues on things like charades.

Also, you'll need to find synonyms to set the puzzles yourself. These scripts are just to help you find the wordplay and not spend hours thinking up a single clue!
